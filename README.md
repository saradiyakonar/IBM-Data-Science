# ðŸš€ IBM Data Science Capstone Project: SpaceX Launch Analysis

This repository contains my completed capstone project for the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**. The project focuses on analyzing historical SpaceX launch data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights using various data science techniques and tools.

## ðŸ“Š Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive data analysis of SpaceX's historical launches and identify factors that contribute to successful launches. This includes:

- Extracting and wrangling data from multiple sources
- Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Creating interactive visualizations using Folium and Plotly
- Building a machine learning model to predict launch success
